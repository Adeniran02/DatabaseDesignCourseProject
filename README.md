Hello there! 

I would like to share one of my coursework projects from the first year of my Data Science program at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology. In today’s data landscape, one of the most sought-after technical skills is the ability to develop an efficient and scalable database design for clients and customers. For this project, I focused on best practices for creating a database model for "Crocs," which I referred to as my client.

In this article, I will provide an outline of how to design a database from the ground up to adapt to changing business requirements. My name is Kehinde, and I am a technical writer and data science enthusiast.
